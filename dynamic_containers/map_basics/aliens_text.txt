Why have humans always believed in supernatural beings? Why have we given them names, outfits, residences, and character
traits? Why would we make this all up if none of it were even true? We do lie, and some of the most common reasons are for
attention, so that people will listen to us and like listening to us because our lives seem so interesting, we also lie
to get what we want, sometimes to cover up low self esteem and most commonly, I believe, as a survival tactic. I think that
is actually where the root of lying comes from. If we have a limited amount of food to feed ourselves and our family for
instance and a friend or neighbor comes over and asks us for some food, we can lie and say we do not have any to protect our
own survival. When we cheat on a lover, we usually lie about it because we fear what our partner will do, will they get angry,
violent, kill us or the other person? I think a lot of lying comes from self preservation even in the case of a person making
up a fantastical story so that they can keep a circle of friends or admirers around as a kind of social security for that
person, so that they are not left alone as they fear they may be if the people got to know the real them or found out their
lives were not really all that interesting.
